<h1 align="center"><b>Example of Genetic Algorithm application to TSP</b></h1>

The idea is to provide an easy, short and non-optimized example of an approximed solution to the [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) through a [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). 
By no means the aim was writing a well performing algorithm, it's intended only as an example of application of GAs to give an hint of their usefulness in solving NP-hard problems.

## Model
x

## Examples
The following two examples are both replicable (with a different seed) using the provided [TSP_GA_example.py](https://github.com/Mark-Zampedroni/genetic-algorithm-example-TSP/blob/main/TSP_GA_example.py) script. All the parameters are freely changeable, different values will result in better/worse solutions. The disposition of the points (cities) can swap between circular and random through the constant ```IS_CIRCLE```.

### E.g 1, Circular disposition
x

### E.g 2, Random disposition
x
